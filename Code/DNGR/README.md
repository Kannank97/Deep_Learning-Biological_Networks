# DNGR-Keras
Deep Neural Networks for Learning Graph Representations (DNGR)
This repository implements [DNGR](https://github.com/ShelsonCao/DNGR.git) using keras,example.py demonstrates its application on wine dataset. 


python DNGR.py --graph_type undirected  --input edge.txt --ouput protein 

output = test1.csv

##the generated vector is saved to a file names test1.csv

##the input must be of the format 
nodeid_1 nodeid_2 weight
ex:  1 2 .25
