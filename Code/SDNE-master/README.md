# SDNE

##my edits documentation
The code is edited to save the embedding generated to a file named - test1.csv

to run the code 
python main.py -c config/disease.ini

output in - test1.csv

-----the input .ini file
the file conatains the details of individual networks in seperate file - includes - edgelist name and dimension
-----to change the dimension 
1. open the ini file
2. look for section [Model_setup] (3rd section) 
3. edit the second value after value -1


--evaluations 
it only includes a sample set of generated vectors

##actual documentation

This repository provides a reference implementation of *SDNE* as described in the paper:<br>
> Structural Deep network Embedding.<br>
> Daixin Wang, Peng Cui, Wenwu Zhu<br>
> Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, 2016.<br>
> <Insert paper link>

The *SDNE* algorithm learns a representations for nodes in a graph. Please check the [paper](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/subtopic/view/structural-deep-network-embedding) for more details. 

### Basic Usage
```
$ python main.py -c config/xx.ini
```
>noted: your can just checkout and modify config file or main.py to get what you want.
### Input
Your input graph data should be a **txt** file or a **mat** file and be under **GraphData folder** 
#### file format
The txt file should be **edgelist** and **the first line** should be **N** , the number of vertexes and **E**, the number of edges

The mat file should be the adjacent matrix. 

you can save your adjacent matrix using the code below

```
import scipy.io as sio
sio.savemat("xxx.mat", {"graph_sparse":your_adjacent_matrix})
```

It is recommended to use mat file and save the adjacent matrix in a sparse form.

#### txt file sample
	5242 14496
	0 1
	0 2
	4 9
	...
	4525 4526

> noted: The nodeID start from 0.<br>
> noted: The graph should be an undirected graph, so if (I  J) exist in the Input file, (J  I) should not.
